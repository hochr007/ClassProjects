This is a the apply function from the filter Sharpen which I created along with every other filter besides the blur filters
and the Undo/Redo capibility. In addition I updated and integrated the Iteration 1 code into the FlashPhoto application. 
This code shows how to implement a kernal based filter which is dependent on the paramter amount to create the proper kernal. 
Unlike filters like Edge detect which require only a fixed kernal and the others which do not need a kernal this filter has a
kernal which changes long with its paramters. Therefore the dynamic allocation is necessary and should imediatly be followed
with code to fill the array with the proper information for the kernal. 
The next important detail in this code is the creation
of a copy PixelBuffer because otherwise the filter will be appling over itself as it passes through the image while this may
not seem like a big deal it will drasticly change the resulting image expecialy in the far corner from where the filter begins
to apply. This is very important because it allows for the most accurate filter aplication as possible which inturn provides 
the best exoerience for the users. 
Another imprtant thing to note is how the kernal is applied to each value in the current PixelBuffer. Four for loops are needed 
first two to acess every pixel in the current PixelBuffer and the inner two loops are to use every value in the kernal. One thing 
that we try to make use of in all code is the use of local variables to simplify function calls whenever possible such as the 
height and width variables in the innermost for loop. Thias allows others to easly understand the code and allows for easy changes 
if the desired values change durring development.
The code above also serves as an example of the coding style which should be useed in this project. At the bgining of each funtion 
a comment gives a shprt description of what the function does as part of the project. Inside the function comments are added to 
add clarity as to the function of code expecialy control loops or other potentialy confusing code.
