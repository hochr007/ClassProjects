this code is used for the blurFilter class and it's purpose is to calculate and set the pixels for each pixel in an image.
the way it works is by using a copy of the current pixelBuffer that is originally passed in (see BlurFilter.cpp). this copy is
then used as a buffer for taking the pixel data. the reason we do this is because the actual current pixelBuffer is constantly
being updated with new "blurred" pixels, so we need a copy of the original so we don't have to worry about using skewed data. 
we then start out with a double nested for loop, as you can see it iterates through the height and width of the pixelBuffer,
basically the entire image. this is done because it is required to apply this blur Filter to every pixel in the image. I then
declare a colorData variable that will later be used to calculate the final Color that will be put into the current pixel being
iterated on. a counter is also created to know how many times a colorData was added to total. the next set of double nested 
for loops is used to iterate through the kernal that is being used. this kernal is populated using the constructor from 
BlurFilter.cpp. basically its a set of distances that each member in the kernal is away from the center. that is why we set the
current distance to whatever piece of the kernal the for loops are on. the first if statement you see is used for edge detection.
when a pixel gets close to the edge, the mask that surrounds it may go off the image slightly. what that if statement does is make 
sure that those specific parts of the mask(kernal) are not used in the averaging of Colors around the pixel we are trying to 
populate. the nested if statement is pretty self explanetory. the "amount" that we get is used as a marker for how many pixels
around the center we need to take in, using the distance variable, it can easily be checked if a part of a kernal is within range
of the center pixel in order to be used.
so if a usable pixel is indeed found, it simply is added to the total and the counter is increased. once we reach the outside of 
the inner nested for loops. the pixel that was calculated needs to actually be applied to the image. to do this, the total is then 
divided by how many pixels were added to it in order to get the average. the "clamped color" function is used to make sure that 
the numbers are proportionally decreased so that they are between 0 and 1. then set pixel actually applies it to the current image.

this method was a major building block for many of the functions including MotionBlur and the blur tool.
