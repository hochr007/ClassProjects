Project: Bloomfilter in Java as a Spellchecker for Basic English


What was the context and contribution?

This project was part of a Algorithm course.

The project was completed individually. All code used from outside sources is acknowledged in the file header.


What was the purpose of the project?

The purpose of the project was to program a Bloomfilter that utilizes hash functions and could be used a spell checker for Basic English, a 850 word version of English. Through the five hash functions, it encodes every word as 5 bits in the array. The program reads in the 850 words listed in basic.txt and then checks if the storing in the filter was done correctly. It also prints the probability of a collision. This probability can be adjusted through a change in the bit array size M.
