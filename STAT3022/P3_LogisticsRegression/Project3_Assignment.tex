Project 3

Analyse the date birthwt from the library MASS. Load the library MASS. By using help file for the data, help(birthwt) first figure out what each variable means.
Ignore the variable bwt. You goal is to understand whether all the remaining variables can determine the birth of an underweight infant. Fit a logistic regression model
Determine what is the response variable and which ones are the covariates. Find out which should be considered as categorical and which ones as quantitative. See
if they are correctly coded in R. Do all the initial EDA and data pre processing necessary before the model fit. After fitting the model, determine which covariates 
are significant and which ones are not. You do not have to use any model selection(covariate selection) technique for this problem.
